# Roblox-User-And-Pass-Gen
Easy way to create a roblox account.

Support the original password generator here: [Coder](https://github.com/ayushi7rawat/Youtube-Projects/tree/master/Random%20Password%20Generator)

## How to use
To use this py file, you need something like PyCharm to run it (thats what i used anyway.)
You need to manually enter this onto the roblox account creation page [Literally this](www.roblox.com)
Just make sure you have signed out or are using a different browser.
Roblox doesnt allow accounts having a username over 20+ chars long, so, make sure you put 20 in the username length when generating.

What it looks like:
