Easy way to create a roblox account.

## How to use
To use this py file, you need something like PyCharm to run it (thats what i used anyway.)
You need to manually enter this onto the roblox account creation page [Literally this](www.roblox.com)
Just make sure you have signed out or are using a different browser.
Roblox doesnt allow accounts having a username over 20+ chars long, so, make sure you put 20 in the username length when generating.

## contributing 
you are more than welcome to contribute since i know nothing about python scripting.
